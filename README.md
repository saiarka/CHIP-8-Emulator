# CHIP-8-Emulator

This is a repository for a CHIP-8 Emulator built in C++17. CHIP-8 is an interpreter used in the 1970's to simplify game programming across different machines. Any machine with 
a CHIP-8 interpreter and respective program could run a CHIP-8 game. 

Understanding the underlying hardware of computer systems, and how programming paradigms utilize said hardware, has always been a fascinating subject to me. To understand it further, I've 
tried my hand at creating a CHIP-8 Emulator to 'emulate' the functionality of the CHIP-8 Interpreter (really I'm also building an interpreter).
